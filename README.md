![circle-ci-logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41597205-a57442ea-73c4-11e8-9591-61f5c83c7e66.png)


A **_step-by-step_ tutorial** for using **Circle CI**
for **Continuous Integration & _Deployment_**!

> **Note**: This guide/tutorial is a vendor-specific set of instructions for
how to enable CI/CD for a Node.js project hosted on GitHub.
For a more _general_ introduction to Continuous Integration,
please read/follow our "Learn Travis" tutorial _first_:
[https://github.com/dwyl/**learn-travis**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis)

## Why?


In a _nutshell_: the reason you would use Circle-CI
is because it's "**free**"<sup>1</sup>. see: https://circleci.com/pricing
![circle-ci-free](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41588366-7032f344-73a9-11e8-8e4c-ee0fbb2656dc.png)

If you have a product owner / client
who wants/needs their code to remain **`private`**
and does not want to _pay_ $49/month for one of the other CI/CD services,
then Circle-CI is your go-to choice.


> <sup>1</sup>Most of our client **`private`** projects that use
Circle-CI don't pay a **penny**.
However one of our clients is **paying** for Circle-CI
because tests in their 3 (actively developed) apps
take up more than **1500** "**free minutes**" to build/test per month.
So we feel they are "breaking even" on us...


## What?

Run your (application/unit/integration/UI) tests using a container on Circle-CI
and ***deploy*** your app to your choice of environment if they pass.

## Who?

This tutorial is aimed at developers who need a way of automatically testing
and deploying their **`private`** apps/code.

### _Prerequisites_?

+ [ ] Basic knowledge of CI concepts.
If you are new to (_or "rusty"_) on CI,
please read/follow our "Learn Travis" tutorial _first_:
[https://github.com/dwyl/**learn-travis**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis)
+ [ ] Basic JavaScript/Node.js knowledge.
+ [ ] 10 Minutes of Time.

No other knowledge/skill/experience is assumed or implied.

> **Stuck?** If you have _any_ questions related to getting started
with Circle-CI or you are "stuck" deploying using the script(s) we demo here,
please open an issue/question and we will try our best to help!

## How

If you do not _already_ have an App that you want to test and deploy,
see:

### 1. Register

Register using your GitHub account: https://circleci.com
(_if you haven't already_)

![circle-login-with-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41608075-87c753b6-73df-11e8-910d-8ab2ebc2d21b.png)


### 2. Add Project

Click the "add project" `+` button from the left-hand side menu.
Then select the project you want Circle-CI to test for you,
and click the "**Setup Project**" button:

![circle-add-project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41619549-950824e6-73fe-11e8-80de-390d56c90aff.png)

You should see something like this now: <br />

![circle-ci-setup-project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41620063-77108e54-7400-11e8-88c5-e434c7cb6474.png)


### 3. Setup `.circleci/config.yml` File

Next, follow the on-screen instructions
to create a `config.yml` folder
and setup your `.circleci/config.yml` file.
```sh
mkdir .circleci
vi .circleci/config.yml
```
Click on the "***Copy To Clipboard***" button to get the code.
_paste_ the sample code into the `.circleci/config.yml`
file you have open in your text editor.

e.g:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41620390-7937da24-7401-11e8-89a2-34a37cb7f130.png)

Save the file, commit it and push to `GitHub`.
e.g: https://github.com/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/commit/ad368321f3fa05686c97a8147f1e5570870bb527

> **Note**: Circle-CI installs **Yarn** by default.
This is ***NOT*** required anymore in 2018.
It adds a _needless_ step to the build process and sends your `package.json`
to Facebook HQ.
I've left it as the `default` for this example, but we don't use Yarn
for _any_ of our Node.js projects, there is ***zero benefit***.

### 4. Start Building

Once you have created the `.circleci/config.yml`,
scroll down the page and click on "**Start building**":

![circle-start-building](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41621257-0945c61a-7404-11e8-86d3-9f206b509d49.png)

You should be redirected to a build progress/status page:

![circle-build-passed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41621398-6e1f49e4-7404-11e8-8d1a-5287bd47d2b5.png)

e.g: https://circleci.com/gh/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/1

The build and running the (_single unit_) test, took **3 seconds**
and ended in "***SUCCESS***".
(_it's a "hello world" example, it should be fast and pass_!)


### 5. Status Badge!

At this point we can add a "Badge" to our project `README.md`
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs)

e.g: https://circleci.com/gh/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/edit#badges
![circle-ci-status-badge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41626981-46e652a2-7416-11e8-8e9e-0a03c8fde0a2.png)

> For why this is a good idea, see: https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges


## Part 2 - Continuous _Deployment_

Continuous Deployment (CD) is the perfect complement
to Continuous Integration (CI)
and people _usually_ use the _same_ "pipeline" (system) to automate it.
It just means that your application is **_automatically_ deployed**
by the CI system (_in this case CircleCI_) when the PR is merged.

> If you are `new` to Continuous Deployment (CD) in _general_
we wrote an introductory post in:
[https://github.com/dwyl/**learn-devops**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-devops)


> <sup>1</sup>As always, we recommend using Heroku for "MVP" App(s) because
it's *much* easier/faster to get started and traction.
see: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku
and: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/deployment-integrations/#heroku
once you ***need*** "more power" than Heroku (_or need to reduce costs_),
take a look at:
[https://github.com/dwyl/**learn-devops**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-devops)

### 6. Pre-Deployment Checks

1. Ensure that you have a `"start"` script in your `package.json`.
e.g:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "test": "node hello.test.js"
  }
}
```

2. Ensure that your app runs on your `localhost` ***before*** attempting
to deploy it to your chosen "cloud" provider.

Run the `start` command:
```sh
npm start
```
![circleci-npm-start-localhost-terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41675959-120936ca-74bc-11e8-8098-7133210dc342.png)

Visit: http://localhost:5000
![circleci-localhost-app-working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41664456-aca9b82c-749d-11e8-83d8-cee513031682.png)

Ok, so it's _working_ on `localhost`; we have a good "baseline". _Onwards_!

> **Note**: there are several ways of starting node.js servers,
(e.g: PM2, Forever or SystemD) we are using `"node server.js"` for simplicity.
But if you are running your own infrastructure,
you will have a _well defined system_ for running/monitoring node.js.


### 7. Deploy!

For this section we are doing an "advanced" deployment
to a DigitalOcean Instance using Dokku
(_which is an Open Source Heroku "clone"_).
It's only "advanced" in that there are a few more "steps"
than deploying to Heroku, but don't worry,
we have documented _everything_ "***step-by-step***"
so it should only take you about 10 minutes to setup.

> _**Note**: as always, if you **get** "**stuck**",
just **open an issue** and we will try our best to help!_
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-circleci/issues

#### 7.1 Add RSA Key

In order to _deploy_ the app via SSH,
we need to add the SSH (RSA) key to CircleCI.
_Thankfully_ this is a _**lot** easier_ thank on Travis-CI!

In your app's Settings page,
1. ***Scroll*** down to the "**Permissions**" section.
2. ***Click*** on **SSH Permissions**
3. ***Click*** on the **`Add SSH Key`** button.
![circleci-add-ssh-key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41679037-d0118b2e-74c4-11e8-8f0d-555e4a0691b2.png)

A "modal" window will appear which allows you to _paste_ your Private Key.
![circleci-add-ssh-private-key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41679036-cffd9f9c-74c4-11e8-8132-33b1298b0b6f.png)
> _**Note**: we do **NOT recommend** using your **personal `private`** key
for deployments! rather you should create a key that is **specific** to
the server you are deploying to
and is **only** "**known**" (used) by your CI/CD system.
see:_ [https://github.com/dwyl/**learn-devops**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-devops)

<!-- note: update this link to the specific section in the Dokku deployment guide
once https://github.com/dwyl/learn-devops/pull/29 is merged! -->

![circleci-ssh-key-added-success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41679038-d02536ba-74c4-11e8-9d25-6c9ae6ea32b8.png)

We have _successfully_ added our SSH _Deployment_ RSA Key!

#### 7.2 Add Deployment Scripts to your Project

Create a `/bin` directory in your project.
```sh
mkdir bin
```
Copy the deployement scripts from:
https://github.com/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/tree/master/bin

You can either do this _manually_ by downloading each file to your project,
or ... using a script!

#### 7.3 Add Required Environment Variables

Add any Environment Variables you need to your `.circleci/config.yml` file.
The IP Address of the server is required as is the `DOKKU_APP` name.

e.g:
```yaml
environment:
   SERVER_IP_ADDRESS: 138.68.163.126
   DOKKU_APP: circlecidemo
   TRAVIS: "false"
```
working example: https://github.com/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/blob/ecfab4a49141da87f36519e50ecda593f01aaf48/.circleci/config.yml#L8

> **Note**: if you need your environment variables to **not**
be in Version Control, add them via the CircleCI Web Interface.
more details: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars

> If you are `new` to Environment Variables,
checkout: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables

#### 7.4 Add Command to Run Deployment Script

Add the following lines to your `.circleci/config.yml` file:

```yaml
# Use BASH instead of DASH! see: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1932504
- run: ls -al /bin/sh && sudo rm /bin/sh && sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh && ls -al /bin/sh
# test shell script:
- run: echo ${SERVER_IP_ADDRESS}
- run: echo -e "Host $SERVER_IP_ADDRESS\n\tStrictHostKeyChecking no\n" >> ~/.ssh/config
- run: sh bin/deploy.sh
```

Working example: https://github.com/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/blob/ecfab4a49141da87f36519e50ecda593f01aaf48/.circleci/config.yml#L43-L48

> Push your code to GitHub and let CircleCI do the rest!
> It usually takes a minute to deploy (_depending on your dependencies_)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41688584-a9f1b552-74e4-11e8-9a2c-5b679fa86b92.png)


In the build log you should see something like:
![circleci-deployed-successfully](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41688249-3dbc795e-74e3-11e8-9988-aaf780e27974.png)

e.g: https://circleci.com/gh/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/18


### 8. Check it Worked!

In our case our `DOKKU_APP` was defined as `circlecidemo`
(_see: section 7.3 above_)
So the deployed app is available on:
https://circlecidemo.ademo.app
If we visit this URL in our browser we see:

![demo-app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41688716-1f79530c-74e5-11e8-8949-5287148841ca.png)

Notice the "Git Hash" value: [dc933373388911d9405fb452c9753f0250766bb3](https://github.com/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/tree/dc933373388911d9405fb452c9753f0250766bb3)

This corresponds to the latest commit on the `master` branch:
https://github.com/nelsonic/circleci-hello-world-nodejs/commits/master
(_GitHub only shows the first 7 characters of the has in the UI
  in this case: `dc93337`_)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/41688820-88ab8ac0-74e5-11e8-9996-d5bb5119a970.png)

So it worked! (_the latest `master` has been deployed by CircleCI!_)
